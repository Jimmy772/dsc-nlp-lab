While the backend code implementation is fairly different, you can think of them as like the Reddit posts of 1995, where a \"category\" in this dataset is like a subreddit.\n","\n","The task is to try to identify the category where a post was published, based on the text content of the post.\n","\n","### Data Understanding\n","\n","#### Data Source\n","\n","Part of what you are practicing here is using the `sklearn.datasets` submodule, which you have seen before (e.g. the Iris Dataset, the Wine Dataset). You can see a full list of available dataset loaders [here](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html#module-sklearn.datasets).\n","\n","In this case we will be using the `fetch_20newsgroups` function ([documentation here](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.fetch_20newsgroups.html)). An important thing to note is that because this is text data, scikit-learn actually downloads a set of documents to the computer you are using to complete this lab, rather than just loading data into memory in Python.\n","\n","#### Features\n","\n","Prior to preprocessing, every row in the dataset only contains one feature: a string containing the full text of the newsgroup post. We will perform preprocessing to create additional features.\n","\n","#### Target\n","\n","As you might have guessed based on the function name, there are 20 categories in the full dataset. Here is a list of all the possible classes:\n","\n","<img src='https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/data-science/images/classes.png'>\n","\n","This full dataset is quite large. To save us from extremely long runtimes, we'll work with only a subset of the classes. For this lab, we'll work with the following five:\n","\n","* `'comp.windows.x'`\n","* `'rec.sport.hockey'`\n","* `'misc.forsale'`\n","* `'sci.crypt'`\n","* `'talk.politics.misc'`"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["### Requirements\n","\n","#### 1. Load the Data\n","\n","Use pandas and `sklearn.datasets` to load the train and test data into appropriate data structures. Then get a sense of what is in this dataset by visually inspecting some samples.\n","\n","#### 2. Perform Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis with `nltk`\n","\n","Standardize the case of the data and use a tokenizer to convert the full posts into lists of individual words. Then compare the raw word frequency distributions of each category.\n","\n","#### 3. Build and Evaluate a Baseline Model with `TfidfVectorizer` and `MultinomialNB`\n","\n","Ultimately all data must be in numeric form in order to be able to fit a scikit-learn model. So we'll use a tool from `sklearn.feature_extraction.text` to convert all data into a vectorized format.\n","\n","Initially we'll keep all of the default parameters for both the vectorizer and the model, in order to develop a baseline score.\n","\n","#### 4. Iteratively Perform and Evaluate Preprocessing and Feature Engineering Techniques\n","\n","Here you will investigate three techniques, to determine whether they should be part of our final modeling process:\n","\n","1. Removing stopwords\n","2. Using custom tokens\n","3. Domain-specific feature engineering\n","4. Increasing `max_features`\n","\n","#### 5.
